# YandexCup
My solutions to two Yandex Cup 2020 test assignments. The first one is the Cables routing problem in computer networks. And the second one is recovering origin text from its animation.
Also I added solutions to the final assignments of YandexCup 2020: 
1. Startup(finding possible combinations of 3 coins to match the sum)
2. Clock(here we got the start and finish times and we need to find the start angle of clock hands, sweep angle, and the fill color of the sector)
3. World of warships(it's a kind of Mines game but have up to 100 possible layers)
